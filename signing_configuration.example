## This is the configuration file that governs PGP signing of the build results.
## Signing operations are initiated by the 'psg_autobuilder_run' user, and can be done
## in two ways:
## 1. By running the 'gpg' command locally.
## 2. By forwarding the data via SSH to a remote host, which performs the signing.
## The first approach is the easiest, while the latter approach is more secure.
##
## More information is documented below.
##
## After closing this editor, the installer will make this file accessible only
## to the 'psg_autobuilder_run' user.
